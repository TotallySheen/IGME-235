## IV. Story

You are the scientist Dr. Mel Koslov, who specializes in wormhole creation. You have just finished your magnum opus, 
a machine that can create infinite wormholes. Just as you put the finishing touches on the machine, it creates a wormhole 
on its own and escapes from your laboratory. You follow the machine through the wormhole, hoping to reach the machine to 
turn it off, so that the universe is not torn apart by the vast amount of wormholes being made.

This game will have a lighthearted mood for the first few areas, which will change to be darker as the game goes on.

## V. Aesthetics

* Graphics: Pixel Art
* Sound: 8-bit

Sounds will come from a light background track, some sound effects based on player movement, 
menu actions, and some sounds to indicate area changes.

## VI. Gameplay

### Mechanics

The player will be able to move around the levels freely via left & right movement, as well as jumping.
The levels will scroll automatically, and each level will last 60-90 seconds.

### Control

Keyboard Controls:

W or ↑ : Jump

A or ← : Move Left

D or → : Move Right

### Teaching

Players are shown the controls on the home screen of the game. These controls will be reiterated upon starting the 
game in the form of on-screen text. The game's mechanics will be described on the home screen as well, but will not 
be reiterated like the controls.

### Player Learning

The player will need to be able to react to the many different platform layouts that could come their way, due to 
the randomized nature of the game. The player will also have to slowly get used to playing at higher speeds, as 
the game will speed up as it goes on to the later levels. To beat the game, less than an hour of experience should 
be required.
